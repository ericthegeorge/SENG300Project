# Self-Checkout Simulator
## Abstract
This project was made for the SENG300 Final Group Project. It attempts to emulate not only the software side involved in a regular self-checkout, but also the hardware side, the attendant side, and of course, the user side. 
The goal is to emulate a virtual self-checkout system, as a learning proof of concept of the design processes in the 'real-world'. That is, we would receive more info from management and the hardware team as we created the project. We would have to meet the criteria the 
'client' (our professor, Dr. Walker) demanded, from regular client meetings to ascertain the product he desired. Since hardware is expensive, we would have to simulate the hardware inputs as we developed our software as well, so as to ensure if effectiveness. 
Please find below an abridged version of the implemented features:
- Virtual barcodes and barcode scanning.
- Local databasing.
- Simulated banknotes of several denominations.
- Tiered checkouts.
- Membership and rewards system.
- Alternative ways to checkout items (PLU, Visual Catalogue).
- Weight checking.
- Coin depositing, including the coin receival process from slot to storage to tray, and change.
- Power utility and power interruption handling.
- Maintenance system.
- Attendant manual override.
- and more...

Note that this was done with the Java Swing GUI framework, as the emphasis was on the logic more so than the UI.
